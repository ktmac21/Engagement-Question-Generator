## Description:
I created an app in which a user can randomly generate an ice breaker question. At the time, daily meetings at my workplace required that I come up an "engagement question" to bond our team. I developed Forced Fun, a simple app in which the user clicks the "Get Question" button to have a random, get-to-know-you, office appropriate, question that will surely support team building. Should the user feel inspired, they can add their own unique question to the database!
