## Description:
As my first post-graduate project I created a generator for ice breaker questions. Daily meetings at my current workplace require that I come up with one of these "engagement questions" to bond our team. In response I have developed Forced Fun, a simple app in which the user clicks the "Get Question" button to have a random, get-to-know-you, office appropriate, question that will surely support team building. Should the user feel inspired, they can add their own unique question to the database!
